## P4-1. `jpeg_calc_jpeg_dimensions` Was Documented But Not Exported — **CLOSED 2026-05-10**

**Status (2026-05-10): closed.** `jpeg_calc_jpeg_dimensions` is now exported from `crates/libjpeg-turbo-rs-capi/src/jpeglib.rs`, re-exported from `src/lib.rs`, and removed from `tests/symbol_inventory.rs::allowlisted_missing_symbols()`.

**Root cause:** the C API reference and feature checklist marked the helper as supported, but the actual cdylib still had it in the missing-symbol allowlist. A new dlopen regression first failed with `symbol not found`, then passed after the implementation.

**Implementation:** `jpeg_calc_jpeg_dimensions(cinfo)` mirrors the upstream no-compression-scaling behavior in `references/libjpeg-turbo/src/jcmaster.c`: `jpeg_width` / `jpeg_height` are copied from `image_width` / `image_height`; `min_DCT_{h,v}_scaled_size` is set to 8 for lossy JPEG and 1 for lossless JPEG. `jpeg_start_compress` now uses the same helper path for its derived compression fields.

**Verification:**

- `cargo test -p libjpeg-turbo-rs-capi --test capi_jpeglib_encode c2_1_calc_jpeg_dimensions_sets_public_compress_fields -- --nocapture` → passed.
- `cargo test -p libjpeg-turbo-rs-capi --test symbol_inventory --release -- --nocapture` → passed; both upstream `jpeglib.h` and `turbojpeg.h` symbol inventories resolve.

## Phase 4 Suggested Order

1. ~~**P4-1** — export `jpeg_calc_jpeg_dimensions` and delete its missing-symbol allowlist entry.~~ **CLOSED 2026-05-10**.
